                            TOPOLOGY 1 (Parallel Then Series )

1) This is the approach used in most passenger car electric vehicles and smaller battery pack designs.
2) All of the cells working in parallel are joined together in groups and then these are joined in Series


PROS

1) Simplest control
2) Lower cost

CONS
1) Capacity of pack determined in design and manufacture
2) No redundancy

                            TOPOLOGY 2  (Series Then Parallel)

1) This approach gives more flexibility for very large packs
2) The cells are wire together in series to get to the full system voltage,these series strings are then connected in parallel

PROS

1) Flexible sizing
2) redundancy
3) Economies of scale

CONS 

1) High cost
2)BMS required for each series string 
3) Out of balance string needs to be left open circuit
