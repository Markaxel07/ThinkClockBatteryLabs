To shift the PWM signal around a 0V mean so that the output waveform varies between -1.65V to +1.65V, you can use an op-amp circuit known as a summing amplifier with a voltage offset. Here's a circuit diagram to achieve this:

                    R1
PWM Signal -----/\/\/\/\-----+----------------------- Output
                             |
                            \ /
                            ---
                             |   Op-Amp
                             |   (Non-Inverting Summing Amplifier)
                             |
                             |
                             |   Vref = 1.65V
                             |
                             |
                            ---
                            / \
                             |
                             |
GND ------------------------+


In this circuit:
- Connect the PWM signal to the inverting input of the op-amp through a resistor R1.
- Connect a voltage reference of 1.65V to the non-inverting input of the op-amp.
- The op-amp will sum the PWM signal and the 1.65V reference voltage, effectively shifting the PWM signal around a 0V mean.
- The output will now vary between -1.65V to +1.65V.

To shift this waveform back to the original level (above 0V), you can use another op-amp circuit known as a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 2. Here's a circuit diagram to achieve this:

                    R2
Input Signal -----/\/\/\/\-----+----------------------- Output
                             |
                            \ /
                            ---
                             |   Op-Amp
                             |   (Non-Inverting Amplifier)
                             |
                             |
                             |   Gain = 2
                             |
                             |
                            ---
                            / \
                             |
                             |
GND ------------------------+


In this circuit:
- Connect the shifted PWM signal to the non-inverting input of the op-amp through a resistor R2.
- Set the feedback resistor of the op-amp to have a ratio of R2 to R3 such that the gain is 2.
- The op-amp will amplify the shifted PWM signal by a factor of 2, effectively shifting it back to the original level above 0V.

These two circuits can be implemented using operational amplifiers and resistors to achieve the desired waveform shifting and restoration.
